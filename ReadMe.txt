DotSerialize 1.2.7 Beta
-------------------------
DotSerialize is a .Net Xml serialization library that is designed to "just work".  What do I mean by "just work"?  Well I mean exactly that, 
which means you should be able to take just about any class or struct instance and use it with DotSerialize without any special attributes 
or other changes to your object.  DotSerialize still supports a number of custom attributes if you wish to customize your data structure.  
DotSerialize is made to be incredibly simple to use but still incredibly customizable as well should you wish to heavily customize the 
way the serializer does its work.

DotSerialize makes use of two oher libraries to work its magic.  One is FasterFlect which is also licensed under the same Apache license 
and can be found at http://fasterflect.codeplex.com/.  The other library used is Ninject which can be found at http://www.ninject.org/.  
Ninject is dual licensed under Apache and Ms-PL.  Both of these libraries are required for DotSerialize to function and they are both 
excellent and useful libraries.
